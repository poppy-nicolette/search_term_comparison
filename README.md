## Keyword co-occurrence edge and node file creation
This repository is for a project to visualize keywords from two search results from academic journals. <br>
It takes full record files from Web of Science and creates edges and nodes files for use in Gephi. <br>
You will need Gephi as a graph interpreter for one of the steps. <br>

This was part of my masters thesis in 2022 and still a work in progress.<br>
Thesis is titled "VISUALIZING KEYWORD CO-OCCURRENCE FROM TWO QUERIES TO AID EXPLORATORY SEARCH" and can be found on the Dalhousie institutional repository, DalSpace. This IR is indexed by Google Scholar, so it should appear there as well. 

## example files
Example outputs are included. There were produced in Gephi, ver 0.9.2. 

### Note
Be sure to follow the steps within the notebook. There are dependencies and you may need to install libraries such as igraph. Links are provided in the notebook. 

#### References
All references are included in the notebook.

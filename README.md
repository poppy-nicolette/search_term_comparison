## Keyword co-occurrence edge and node file creation
This repository is for a project to visualize keywords from two search results from academic journals. <br>
It takes full record files from Web of Science and creates edges and nodes files for use in Gephi. <br>
You will need Gephi as a graph interpreter for one of the steps. <br>

This was part of my masters thesis in 2022 and still a work in progress.<br>
